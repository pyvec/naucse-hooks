# Webhooks for naucse.python.cz

There's current only one hook at ``/hooks/push`` which reacts to GitHub push event and triggers a rebuild of naucse.
In case there are already some builds running on Travis for the target branch, they're cancelled.
The build is only triggered if the pushed branch is used as a link in the root naucse repository. 
The hook also reacts to ping events which are sent by GitHub when the webhook is being setup.

Appart for the hook, this app can install the hook to repositories, if everything is configured.
The installation is at ``/``. The OAuth callback is at ``/github-callback``.
